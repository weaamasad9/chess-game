# ♟️ Chess Game in C++

This is a fully object-oriented chess game implemented in C++.  
It uses modular classes to represent different chess pieces, the board, and the game logic, with basic graphical support via a custom `chessGraphics` library.

## 🎯 Features
- OOP structure: Base `Piece` class + derived classes (`King`, `Queen`, `Bishop`, etc.)
- Valid move logic for each piece
- Turn-based play
- Board state management
- Custom lightweight graphics interface (`chessGraphics`)

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- C++ object-oriented programming and polymorphism
- Clean modular file structure with `.h` and `.cpp` separation
- Use of external graphics library
- Visual Studio project management (`.vcxproj`)
